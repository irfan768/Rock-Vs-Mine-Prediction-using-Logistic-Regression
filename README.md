# Rock-Vs-Mine-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
In this project, I have used logistic regression for the prediction of data sample whether it is a "Rock" or it is a "Mine". Moreover, I have designed a prompt where you can give any random sample from the dataset and tell the model to predict its class.


To execute this code in your system, follow the steps:
**Introduction**
The Sonar Object Prediction System is designed to classify sonar signals into two categories: Rock or Mine. The system uses logistic regression and a standard scaler for preprocessing the input data. The user can enter the sonar signal values through the GUI, and the system will predict whether the object is a Rock or a Mine.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is the Sonar dataset. I have uploaded the dataset file also, you can download and use it. The dataset contains 60 feature columns representing the sonar signal values and one target column indicating the object type ('R' for Rock and 'M' for Mine).

**Requirements**
To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

**numpy

pandas

scikit-learn

tkinter**

You can install these libraries using pip:
**** **pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn** ****

Change the path of dataset inside project1.py with your own dataset path
Execute the code for the prediction

You will see a prompt where you need to enter the test sample(**of 60 values**), then click the Predict button and you will see the prediction result in the textbox.
